# Tweets-Clustering-using-k-means
By clustering similar tweets together, we can generate a more concise and organized representation of the raw tweets, which will be very useful for many Twitter-based applications (e.g., truth discovery, trend analysis, search ranking, etc.)

Steps to run:
i)	open python command line interface (or Anaconda command prompt) at the location where the python file (name: k_mean.py), included in this project, is located.

ii)	type the following command, make sure to enclose the full paths and pruning factor in double quotes:

python k_mean.py <value of K> <full path of initial seed file > <full path of tweets file> <path on the computer where you want to save output>

Eg: >>> python k_mean.py 25 "C:/Users/Rishav/InitialSeeds.txt" "C:/Users/Rishav/data.json" "C:/Users/Rishav/tweets-k-means-output.txt"

iii)	Please give it some time
